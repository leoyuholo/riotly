# Riotly coding test

## Development
**Prerequisite**: Need to have [docker](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-ubuntu/plans/docker-ce-server-ubuntu-tier?tab=instructions) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) ](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on system.

Before starting development, need to install dependencies first. Edit `docker-compose.yaml` to run `pip` and `npm install` first.

After installed dependencies, simplily run `docker-compose up` to spin up the development environment. You may edit `docker-compose.yaml` to run different scripts.
